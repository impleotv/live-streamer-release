## License

No license is needed for application evaluation - it will work in demo mode (with some restrictions). 

**LiveStreamer** is a node locked software, so you have to get a license (after purchasing the SW) in order to lift demo restrictions. Please install the application and fill an [online form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd_XW6bDsFce1G1cpds4gMQNlwNax0CvkWzcMbscxZ5rLaIbA/viewform), providing the ***Node Info*** string (IMPORTANT!!!) for the target machine.  

Node Info string can be seen when you run the application:

Applying license. Use one of two options:

- passing license info as the arguments (with --licenseFile and --licenseKey)
- copying license file (.lic) and a key (.txt) file into current working directory
